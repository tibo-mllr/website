# Project view

This view is accessible to all users.

It displays all the projects I have worked on.

`admin` users can create new projects.

`superAdmin` users can also update and delete projects.

If the type of the project is Tech Experience, a typeahead input allows the user to select among the available organizations of the [organization view](../organization#readme), or to create a new one.
