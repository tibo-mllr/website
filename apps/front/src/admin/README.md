# Admin view

This view is only accessible to users with the `admin` role.

For `admin` users, it is only like an 'account' view. They can see their information and update their password.

For `superAdmin` users, it is a real admin view. They can see all users, update their information (even password, in case it has been lost) and their roles, can create new users or delete them.

The roles are mainly for me a way to learn how to manage roles and permissions in a web application. They have different rights on the application, but it may not be relevant.
