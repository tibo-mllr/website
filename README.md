# Personal website project

This is my personal website project. Might always be useful to have one.
Familiarising more with reactjS and nestJS, and learning mongoDB.

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- MongoDB

## Usage

You always need to have two terminals open, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```
